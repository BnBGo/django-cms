Our menu of pages is growing.

As we continue adding pages, we're going to start running out of space. There's room for three, but
there won't be for 30.

The solution is to *nest* pages, in a hierarchy, so that rather than::

    home
    how to find us
    people

it's::

    home
    contact information
        how to find us
        people

.. todo:: screenshots of following steps (if they are new steps)
