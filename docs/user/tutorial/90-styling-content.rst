    * header created in 80-site-wide-content
    * content:

        Our workshop is at Zollstrasse 53, Zürich. We're open 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
        every day of the year.

        The map we added in 30-structure-content-modes

    * footer created in 80-site-wide-content

We'll use the *columns* functionality to place the text and the map side-by-side, in columns.

.. todo:: Please create screenshots of steps required to place the existing content into two columns

This is a very basic example of styling.

Let's do something a bit more ambitious with the *Home* page of the site.

Here we have various items of content.

            a puncture to a cracked frame.
