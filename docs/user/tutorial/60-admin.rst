* move file to clipboard
* move up in folder hierarchy to root level

Editing items
=============

.. todo:: screenshots of following steps

.. todo:: write up steps properly

You can edit a file's details by selecting it.

* select one of the existing images
* edit ``Name`` and ``Description``
* Choose the image's *focus point* - the point around which any cropping will occur - by dragging
  the red circle in the image pane

  This helps ensure for example that however a portrait is cropped, the subject's head will not be
  chopped off. If your image doesn't have a particular focus point, leave the circle in the middle
  of the image.

* **Save** the image.

Note that if you change the focus point, any examples of that image already in your pages will
change automatically.
