Aldryn Bootstrap 3 plugins
**************************

There's a raft of plugins available for you to experiment with in the tutorial site. They include
the `Aldryn Bootstrap 3 addon <https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-bootstrap3/wiki>`_ plugins - you've
used several of these already - but you'll find many others listed there too. And of course, there
are numerous other plugins from other applications to explore.


Accordion
================

.. todo:: add image of Accordion with one item expanded

The *Accordion* (an *Accordion* is a web widget that collapses and expands, hence the name, to
reveal its contents) plugin works in a similar way - you add the *Accordion* plugin to a
placeholder in the usual fashion, then add *Accordion item* plugins to the *Accordion*.

An *Accordion item* plugin itself contains other plugins; these are the items that can be shown and
hidden.

#.  Add an *Accordion* plugin to a placeholder on any page. Add a title to it, and **Save**.
#.  Add some *Accordion item* plugins to the *Accordion*.
#.  To each *Accordion item*, add another plugin - perhaps some *Text* or an *Image*.
