Styling content - yet more work with columns
####################################################

*************************************
Further improvements to the home page
*************************************

Also on the home page, we have a *Text* plugin and a *Latest articles* plugin.

We don't need to repeat all the steps, but it's easy now to place these two plugins into separate *Column* plugins, just as you did for the content on the *How to find us* page.

This is how the content placeholder looks in the structure mode.

Seems like a lot, but it is actually pretty simple to achieve. Follow these steps:

1. Add a new row plugin with *2 columns* and set both to *col-sm-12*.

2. After they have been created, doubleclick on the first one and change the column width to *col-sm-16*. Open the second column and set that to *col-sm-8*.

3. Accordingly take the text plugin you firstly created on the homepage and drop it in the first column.

4. For the second column, chose the *image* plugin. Select a nice picute or upload one and hit *save*.

5. You might notice that that it does't align the top of the image to the text on the left. To make sure it looks nice, we're gonna add a new plugin to make some space.

6. The spacer plugin helps to keep the white space between the elements and also to align them correctly. Just play around with the different options you have and select the one that fits the most.

The same spacer plugin is used between the different sections.
